Do you believe aliens exists and have visited our planet?","For many generations, humans have wondered and fantasized about the existence of extraterrestrial life and if we have encountered them on our planet. The first record of this question was found in the pre-modern period, where writers assumed that living beings would inhabit the extraterrestrial worlds, though it is hard to pinpoint what extraterrestrial worlds these writers were referring to. 
In the 15th century, William Vorilong acknowledged the possibility that Christ could have visited other worlds besides the one we are residing at the moment to redeem their inhabitants. 
In 1440, Nicholas of Cusa wrote that the Earth was “a brilliant star” like other celestial objects visible in space. He theorized that, including the Sun, all extraterrestrial bodies could be inhabited by men, plants, and animals.

According to an article published by the History magazine, Betty and Barney Hill were chased by a UFO and abducted by aliens on a September night in 1961. The couple felt drowsy and lost consciousness after being chased by a mysterious flying saucer. When they gained consciousness, it was two hours later and they were 35 miles down the road. Their close contact details with Aliens were later recovered with the help of hypnosis.

Several government officials have been vocal about the existence of aliens and UFOs on Earth in the past decade. In the documentary, ""the Phenomenon"", former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid spoke out about his belief in UFOs being linked to the existence of extraterrestrial life. In the documentary, Reid claimed “the federal government all these years has covered up [important information about UFOs], put brake pads on everything, stopped it, I think it’s very, very bad for our country.”

 

Reid is is widely considered as one of the most experienced public figures speaking out about extraterrestrial life on Earth. After receiving his law degree from George Washington University, Reid began his public career as a city attorney for Henderson, Nevada in 1968. Ever since then, he served in the public sector for 40 years in a variety of government positions - such as Lieutenant Governor of Nevada, United States Senator from Nevada, and Senate Majority Whip - all the while he and other prominent officials have continued to advocate for the high probability that extraterrestrial entities have been to Earth.",Timing - First Click,Timing - Last Click,Timing - Page Submit,Timing - Click Count,"Read the following facts supporting and challenging the existence of aliens on Earth.

While 19 of these instances were confirmed as ""airborne clutter"" (i.e. unwanted echoes in aerial electronic systems, particularly in reference to radars), the majority of these instances remain unidentified.

How important do you believe recycling programs are in the United States as they are currently implemented?","Recycling programs in the US can definitely be improved as they are often inefficiently run and many studies question to what extent recycled products like paper and plastics actually provide environmental benefit. Even with their setbacks though, there are many studies that prove that both 1.) the economic benefits associated with recycling jobs greatly exceeds the costs and 2.) the environmental benefits of recycling glass and metals one of the best ways individuals and businesses can advocate for environmental stewardship.","You are not alone in your belief of the benefits on recycling! Even though recycling programs in the U.S. can definitely be improved, studies show time and time again that recycling is one of the best ways individuals and businesses can advocate for environmental stewardship while also providing jobs and maintaining cleanliness of our communities.","According to the Environmental Protection Agency, recycling can SIGNIFICANTLY reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions that lead to climate change. This is because taking raw materials from the earth like oil, trees, and metal ores – then processing those into packages and other materials like glass products or aluminum cans – requires a lot of energy.


 


The National League of Cities, whose mission is to strengthen and promote city level economic development, conducted a 5-year comprehensive study from 2007 to 2012 on programs that boost individual city's and municipality's growth. Through this study, they found that creating robust recycling programs is one of the most cost-effective and quickest ways to promote local job creation. These “green jobs” can involve collecting curbside recyclables, processing recycled materials, supplying the materials to companies, transporting materials, maintaining equipment, and more.",Timing - First Click,Timing - Last Click,Timing - Page Submit,Timing - Click Count,"When did the first instance of modern-day recycling begin in America and how did the topic become the poster child of the fight against climate change? The closest 19th-century equivalent to modern-day recycling was the ragman, who went from house to house to buy old cloth to make into paper.
 

When garbage pickup started in the late 19th century, many cities separated reusable trash from landfill garbage and as early as 1910, workers sorted these reusable materials from garbage via conveyor belts. The cities sold the reusable trash to industries while many individuals saved their organics to feed to animals.
 

In the 1920s, this separation process declined rapidly. By then, not much was being recycled apart from metal at scrap yards. Then during World War II, industries and communities separated and reused tin cans, recycled nylons, cooking fats, and even the tin in toothpaste tubes for the war effort.
 

In the 1960s, the first recycling programs linked began to take off due to environmental concerns, though most people in the throw-away society of the time didn’t think too much about preservation... that is until landfills started filling up in the 1970’s.
 

Today, most major cities in the US have robust waste management and recycling programs, and while the benefits can be substantial, cities must organize their programs in a way where the recycling process does not cause more environmental or economic harm than good.",Timing - First Click,Timing - Last Click,Timing - Page Submit,Timing - Click Count,"Despite the environmental and economic benefits, there are some drawbacks with current recycling practices in the United States that need to be addressed.

			In 2021, there were 250,000 full-time U.S. employees who worked in the recycling and composting industry (not including waste management jobs).
			
			An estimated 7 million tons of materials were sold for use in China and SouthEast Asia in 2020, of which 90% of which could have been recycled and reused in America instead of shipping overseas. The green house gas emissions associated with shipping this material significantly reduces the impact of recycling it in the first place.

Undoubtedly, social networking plays a vital role in broadening teen social connections and helping them learn valuable technical skills. But what impact is all of this social networking having on young teen minds? Multiple studies have shown that social media usage has a negative impact on the mental health of teenagers, including depression, anxiety, and sleep deprivation.


Dr. Amy Orben is a leading researcher at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit, University of Cambridge., and leads the Digital Mental Health program at the MRC CBU. In her recent study, Dr. Orben discovered that the cross-sectional relationship between self-reported estimates of social media use and life satisfaction ratings is most negative in younger adolescents ages 12-16. This time period is a particularly sensitive developmental window in adolescence, when higher estimated social media use directly correlates with a decrease in life satisfaction ratings (and vice-versa: lower estimated social media use predicts an increase in life satisfaction ratings). With each subsequent year of frequent use, the life satisfaction rating for adolescent continues to decrease.",Timing - First Click,Timing - Last Click,Timing - Page Submit,Timing - Click Count,"In 1987, the direct precursor to today’s internet came into being when the National Science Foundation launched a more robust, nationwide digital network known as the NSFNET.
